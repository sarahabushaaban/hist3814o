#May 26, 2019: Exercise 1 - Database Searches
To conduct a random search, I specified place of commemoration to be Israel and Palestine (including Gaza) and ticked the Second World W
ar box to narrow results - and narrow they were. Only one result appeared. I downloaded the 'results'.
This is a link to my results: https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?country=Israel%2band%2bPalestine%2b(including%2bGaza)&war=
2&tab=wardead&fq_cemeterymemorial=GAZA+WAR+CEMETERY&fq_servedwithliteral=Canadian
Then, I conducted a search of my family name and unsurprisingly, did not come up with any results.

Then, in the EDH database, I restricted my search to the province of Arabia and the modern country Israel, and came up with three results.
